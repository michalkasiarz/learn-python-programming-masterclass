# Create a program that allows a user to choose one of
# up to 9 time zones from a menu. You can choose any
# zones you want from the all_timezones list.
#
# The program will then display the time in that timezone, as
# well as local time and UTC time.
#
# Entering 0 as the choice will quit the program.
#
# Display the dates and times in a format suitable for the
# user of your program to understand, and include the
# timezone name when displaying the chosen time.
