# Modify the program so that the exits is a dictionary rather than a list,
# with the keys being the numbers of the locations and the values being
# dictionaries holding the exits (as they do at present). No change should
# be needed to the actual code.
#
# Once that is working, create another dictionary that contains words that
# players may use. These words will be the keys, and their values will be
# a single letter that the program can use to determine which way to go.
